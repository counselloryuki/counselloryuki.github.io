With three years of professional school Counselor/ Marriage and Family Therapy training at California State University-East Bay, my work primarily focused on academic intervention and mental health support to children and adolescents. I have been interested in working with diverse populations based on my cross-culture background. Additionally, I also had taught voice and music at Taiwan municipal elementary school for 18 years. I sincerely hope to enjoy an adventurous journey with students and support them to have the best school life path.
